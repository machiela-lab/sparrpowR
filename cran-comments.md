## This is the eigth resubmission

* Actions taken since previous submission:
  * Addressed ERROR on R-devel CRAN environments by setting `parallelly.makeNodePSOCK.setup_strategy = sequential` for all CRAN tests as suggested by the maintainer for the `future` and `parallelly` packages who is actively working on a solution <https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/parallelly/issues/65>

* Documentation for `pval_correct()` references a doi <https://doi.org/10.2307/2283989> that throws a NOTE but is a valid URL
